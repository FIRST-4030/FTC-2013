Sonar Sensor Calibration:
	Values between 5 and 255
	In inches
	1	23
	2	8
	3	12
	4	15
	5	21
	6	22

	16	41
	20	52
	24	61
	28	74

	36	91
	40	102
	44*	113

	For perpendicular reads, sensor loses granularity at around 36 inches.
	
Analysis:
	Robot is maximum 18 inches.
	Distance from starting wall to corner of ramp is 36 inches.
	If we mount sonar on front of robot, distance will be around 18 inches to the corner of the ramp.
	
Conclusion:
	Sonar sensor is useful but really only when perpendicular.
